          Today, on Rose Day, I long to be by your side, to hand you a rose and celebrate our love together. But distance once again keeps us apart. When we meet, we'll relive these missed moments with joy. <br>

Every day, my love for you grows like the petals of a roseâ€”delicate yet resilient, enduring through challenges. You mean the world to me, and I hope to make every moment special for you. <br>

Happy Rose Day, my love. Until we can celebrate together, know you're always in my thoughts and heart.
